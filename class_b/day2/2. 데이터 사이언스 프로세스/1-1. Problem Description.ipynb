    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. \n",
    "For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric\n",
    "Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known simply as **\"accuracy”.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission File Format\n",
    "You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file should have exactly 2 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "PassengerId (sorted in any order)\n",
    "Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n"
